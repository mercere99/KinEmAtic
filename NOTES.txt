--== For Slideshow ==--
See if we can make layers non-transparent for crisper fonts.
Certain objects don't need to always be stored long-term.
  These include : Font, Color, Position.
  We should have different default versions of these that just get modified on the fly as needed.
Make sure to swallow keystrokes when acting on them.

--== Development Notes ==--

Once we have a first draft of the basic framework:
* Make sure copy constructors work properly, and encourage the use of template objects
* Most Set methods should return the class object so that they can be chained.
* Build a library of canvas shapes (lattice, arrow, etc.) to easily plug into things like button images.
* Add an OK() method to many classes that will use emk::Alerts to warn of problems?

Specific class improvements:
* Fix images so that they don't try to draw if they're not loaded.
* Control class should allow for easy relationships to track when building objects (and perhaps maintained through size changes?)
* Buttonsets should allow dynamic spacers.
* EventChains need to be able to handle callbacks and animations
* Images need to be retuned and made so things like GetWdith work (while other methods explicitly don't)

Several new classes to incorporate:
* Other shapes (circles, etc.)
* A font class that handles font family, size, color, etc.
* ObjectCollections that allow shifting between objects  (E.g., Run .Flip() to flip to the alternate object)

Optimizations / cleanup:
* Split up Kinetic.h into multiple files
* Grid class would be faster if it only did updates rather than full redraws with every change.
* When we pass back an object from JS, can we just plug in the memory block rather than copying it?
* Setting "canvas.mozOpaque = true;" will cause layers to be opaque but crisper text in Firefox.
* Setup a map<string, emkJSCallback *> to keep track of "On" callbacks and replace them properly (i.e., deleting the
  older ones) when needed.

For Web-Avida:
* Figure out modes we want; probably based on text viewer.
  - [P]opulation (was map)      : LEFT - MAP             RIGHT - Population Stats (Avg, Dom, Active)
  - [O]rganism (was zoom)       :        Organism                Org stats & CPU State
  - [A]analyze (same)           :        Graphs/visualizations   Manipulation commands & display options
  - [C]onfigure (was options)   :        List of options         Help
  - ?[T]imeline (past milestones and scheduled events)
  - ?[E]nvironment (including resources, tasks, reactions, etc.)
  - Full freezer (not seperate option unless no room)
* Under map:  Rewind (no shortcut?  Or should confirm?)  
              Pause/Play (spacebar)
              Freeze population
              Step ([N]ext update)
              Randomize?  Jumbles the population.
              Pulldown to choose [M]ap mode (also controls small histogram under map that matches color?)
              - Genotype
              - Fitness
              - Gestation rate
              - Metabolic rate
              - ?Blank (just leave updates flipping by...)

Other libraries to think about:
