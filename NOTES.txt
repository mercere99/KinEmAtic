* Implement events with pass-back info (coordinates, keypresses, etc.)
* Implement other shapes (circles, etc.)
* Change all in_var to just _var.
* Split up Kinetic.h into multiple files.

Once we have a first draft of the basic framework:
* Refactor to parallel the object heirarchy of Kinetic for easier compatability.
* Come up with more intelligent default values

Several new classes to incorporate:
* A font class that handles font family, size, color, etc.
* A coordinates class.

Optimizations:
* Grid class would be faster if it only did updates rather than full redraws with every change.
* When we pass back an object from JS, can we just plug in the memory block rather than copying it?

Cleanup:
* Setup a map<string, emkJSCallback *> to keep track of "On" callbacks and replace them properly (i.e., deleting the
  older ones) when needed.
