* Refactor to parallel the object heirarchy of Kinetic for easier compatability.  For example, coordinates of all shapes should be demoted to the generic shape base class.

* Come up with more intelligent default values (e.g., colors could start as "Unknown")...

* Change all in_var to just _var.

* Clean up pass-back of values from JS functions (such as frames in an animation).

Several new classes to incorporate:
* A color class to handle RGBa and convert as needed.
* A font class that handles font family, size, color, etc.
* A coordinates class.


Other libraries to think about:
d3.js
Processing.js
