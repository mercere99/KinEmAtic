* Implement other shapes (circles, etc.)
* Change all in_var to just _var.
* Split up Kinetic.h into multiple files (especially for callbacks...)

Once we have a first draft of the basic framework:
* Refactor to parallel the object heirarchy of Kinetic for easier compatability.
* Come up with more intelligent default values
* Make sure copy constructors work properly.
* Tween onFinish http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-transition-callback-with-kineticjs/

Several new classes to incorporate:
* A font class that handles font family, size, color, etc.
* A coordinates class.

Optimizations / improvements:
* Grid class would be faster if it only did updates rather than full redraws with every change.
* When we pass back an object from JS, can we just plug in the memory block rather than copying it?
* Setting "canvas.mozOpaque = true;" will cause layers to be opaque but crisper text in Firefox.
* Similarly, adding 0.5 to coordinate values is supposed to make lines crisper...

Cleanup:
* Setup a map<string, emkJSCallback *> to keep track of "On" callbacks and replace them properly (i.e., deleting the
  older ones) when needed.
* Merge images back into main array of kinetic objects so that GetX, GetWidth, etc. work.


Stack Overflow Questions
* Tween onReverseFinish, for linking two tweens together in reverse?

* Can a Tween be changed once it is created, or do I need to create a new one?

Possible names:
Emote - short enough for a proper namespace
Emu - Nice and short, relates to gnu, but sounds too much like emulation.
Empirical - Brings in science aspect, but long name (probably emp:: namesapce?) (or just call it Pirical?)
Evoke - Steps out of em- prefix, but that's okay.  But the name is probably better for EALib
Embassy - I like how it makes clear that it's linking two places together, but long.
Emdemic or emsemble - made up words that highlight the linkages.
