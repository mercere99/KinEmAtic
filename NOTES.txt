* Implement image handling
* Implement events with pass-back info
* Implement other shapes (circles, etc.)
* Implement free-drawing on canvas.
* Clean up pass-back of values from JS functions (such as frames in an animation).
* Change all in_var to just _var.

Once we have a first draft of the basic framework:
* Refactor to parallel the object heirarchy of Kinetic for easier compatability.
* Come up with more intelligent default values (e.g., colors could start as "Unknown")...

Several new classes to incorporate:
* A color class to handle RGBa and convert as needed.
* A font class that handles font family, size, color, etc.
* A coordinates class.


Other libraries to think about:
d3.js
Processing.js
